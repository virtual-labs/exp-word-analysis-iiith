## Morphological Analysis: Theory & Practice

Morphological analysis is a foundational task in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It involves breaking down a word into its root and affix(es), which is essential for understanding word structure and meaning in any language.

### 1. What is Morphological Analysis?

> **Definition:**
> Analysis of a word into root and affix(es) is called *morphological analysis* of a word. Identifying the root of a word is mandatory for any NLP task.

#### Example: Word Forms Across Languages
- **English:**
  - Root: 'play'
  - Forms: 'play', 'plays', 'played', 'playing'
- **Hindi:**
  - Root: 'खेल' (khela)
  - Forms: खेल, खेला, खेली, खेलूंगा, खेलूंगी, खेलेगा, खेलेगी, खेलते, खेलती, खेलने, खेलकर
- **Telugu:**
  - Root: ఆడడం (Adadam)
  - Forms: ఆడుతాను, ఆడుతున్నాను, ఆడేను, ఆడేం, ఆడేవా, ...

> **Checkpoint:**
> - Why is it important to identify the root of a word in NLP?
> - Can you think of a word in your language that has many forms?

### 2. Morphological Richness

The number of forms a root word can take varies across languages. Indian languages are generally considered *morphologically rich*, meaning words can have many forms due to inflections and derivations.

### 3. Types of Morphology

#### **Inflectional Morphology**
- Deals with word forms of a root where there is **no change in lexical category**.
- Example: 'played' is an inflection of 'play' (both are verbs).

#### **Derivational Morphology**
- Deals with word forms of a root where there **is a change in lexical category**.
- Example: 'happiness' is a derivation of 'happy' (adjective → noun).

> **Checkpoint:**
> - What is the difference between inflectional and derivational morphology?
> - Give an example of each from any language you know.

### 4. Morphological Features

During morphological analysis, each word is assigned a *lexical category* and may take suffixes for features such as gender, number, person, case, tense, aspect, and modality.

#### **Nouns & Pronouns**
- Can take suffixes for: **gender, number, person, case**

##### Example Analyses
| Language | Input Word | Output Analysis |
|---|---|---|
| Hindi | लडके (ladake) | rt=लड़का(ladakaa), cat=n, gen=m, num=sg, case=obl |
| Hindi | लडके (ladake) | rt=लड़का(ladakaa), cat=n, gen=m, num=pl, case=dir |
| Hindi | लड़कों (ladakoM) | rt=लड़का(ladakaa), cat=n, gen=m, num=pl, case=obl |
| English | boy | rt=boy, cat=n, gen=m, num=sg |
| English | boys | rt=boy, cat=n, gen=m, num=pl |

#### **Verbs**
- Can take suffixes for: **tense, aspect, modality, gender, number, person**

##### Example Analyses
| Language | Input Word | Output Analysis |
|---|---|---|
| Hindi | हँसी(hansii) | rt=हँस(hans), cat=v, gen=fem, num=sg/pl, per=1/2/3 tense=past, aspect=pft |
| English | toys | rt=toy, cat=n, num=pl, per=3 |

> **Checkpoint:**
> - What features are typically analyzed for nouns? For verbs?
> - Try analyzing a word from your language using these features.

### 5. Feature Glossary

- **rt**: root
- **cat**: lexical category (noun, verb, adjective, pronoun, adverb, preposition)
- **gen**: gender (masculine or feminine)
- **num**: number (singular (sg) or plural (pl))
- **per**: person (1, 2, or 3)
- **tense**: present, past, or future (for verbs)
- **aspect**: perfect (pft), continuous (cont), or habitual (hab) (for verbs)
- **case**: direct or oblique (for nouns)

> **Checkpoint:**
> - What is the difference between direct and oblique case in Hindi? Why doesn't English have this distinction?

**Note:**
- A case is *oblique* when a postposition occurs after a noun. If no postposition can occur after a noun, the case is *direct*.
- Some Hindi postpositions: का(kaa), की(kii), के(ke), को(ko), में(meM)

### 6. Summary

Morphological analysis is crucial for understanding and processing natural language, especially in morphologically rich languages like Hindi and Telugu. By breaking words into their roots and features, we can better analyze, translate, and generate language computationally.
