the word 'cat' is simple because one cannot further decompose the word into smaller part. On the other hand, the word 'cats' is complex, because the word is made up of two parts: root 'cat' and plural suffix '-s'</div>

Analysis of words into root and affix(es) are called Morphological analysis of the word.  It is mandatory to identify root of a word for any natural language processing task. A root word can have various forms. For example, the word 'play' in English has the following forms: 'play', 'plays', 'played' and 'playing'. Hindi shows more number of forms for the word 'खेल' which is equivalent to 'play'. The forms of 'khela' are the following:</p><br>

खेल, खेला, खेली, खेलुंगा, खेलुंगी, खेलेगा, खेलेगी, खेलते, खेलती, खेलने, खेलकर <br><br>

For Telugu root Adadam (ఆడడం), the forms are the following::<br><br>

Adutaanu, AdutunnAnu, Adenu, Ademu, AdevA, AdutAru, Adutunnaru, AdadAniki, Adesariki, AdanA, Adinxi, Adutunxi, AdinxA, AdeserA, Adestunnaru, ... <br><br>
<p>
Thus we understand morphological richness of one language might vary from that of another language. Indian languages are generally morphologically rich languages and therefore morphological analysis of words become a very significant task for Indian languages.</p><br>

<b>Types of Morphology</b><br><br>

Morphology is of two types,<br><br>

   1. Inflectional morphology<br><br>

      Deals with word forms of a root, where there is no change in lexical category. For example, 'played' is an inflection of the root word 'play'. Here, both 'played' and 'play' are verbs.<br>
   2. Derivational morphology<br><br>

      Deals with word forms of a root, where there is a change in the lexical category. For example, the word form 'happiness' is a derivation of the word 'happy'. Here, 'happiness' is a derived noun form of the adjective 'happy'.<br><br>

<b>Morphological Features:</b><br><br>

All words will have its lexical category attested during morphological analysis.<br>
A noun and pronoun can take suffix of the following features: gender, number, person, case<br>
For example, morphological analysis of the words are given below:<br><br>
<pre>
Language   input:word   output:analysis
Hindi      लडके                     rt=लड़का, cat=n, gen=m, num=sg, case=obl 
Hindi      लडके                     rt=लड़का, cat=n, gen=m, num=pl, case=dir 
Hindi      लड़कों                    rt=लड़का, cat=n, gen=m, num=pl, case=obl
</pre>
<br><br>      
A verb can take suffix of the following features: tense, aspect, modality, gender, number, person
<br><br>
<pre>
Language   input:word    output:analysis
Hindi      हँसी                       rt=हँस, cat=v, gen=fem, num=sg/pl, per=1/2/3 tense=past, aspect=pft 
English    toys	         rt=toy, cat=n, num=pl, per=3    	
</pre>
<br>
'gen' stands for gender. The value of gender can be masculine, feminine or neuter in Hindi. For English, it is only masculine or feminine.<br>
'num' stands for number. The value of number can be singual (sg) or plural (pl).<br>
'per' stands for person. The value of person can be 1, 2 or 3<br>
The value of tense can be present, past or future.<br>
The value of aspect can be perfecT (pft), continuous (cont) or habitual (hab).<br>

		<b>1.</b> Choose a typical masculine noun, ending in ’A’, from your language. Write down its various forms along with various features and their values associated with them.
<br><br>
<b>2.</b> English has a suffix –en whose use is illustrated in the following lists:
<br><pre>
List A			List B
red			redden
mad			madden
soft			soften
wide			widen
sharp			sharpen
</pre>
In regard to these data, answer the following questions:
<br>
A.	What part of speech does the suffix –en attach to?  That is, what is the part of speech of the words in list A?
<br>
B.	When the suffix –en is attached to a word, what part of speech is the resulting word?  Give some specific 
	morphological properties of one of the words in list B, in order to justify your answer.
<br><br>
<b>3.</b> Take one verb from your mother tongue, gloss it (i.e., give the Engish meaning) and conjugate it in all tenses and aspects and persons. 
<br><br>
<b>4.</b> Refer to the following data and answer the question below:

List 1: taller, shorter, higher, lower, smarter
List 2: mower, teacher, sailor, caller, operator
List 3: never, cover, finger, river
