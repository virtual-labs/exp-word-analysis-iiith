      "question": "What is the primary purpose of word analysis in natural language processing?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To translate words between languages",
        "b": "To understand the grammatical and morphological features of words",

        "d": "To arrange words alphabetically"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. While translation is a use case, word analysis focuses on understanding word structure and features.",
        "b": "Correct! Word analysis helps identify grammatical categories, morphological features, and word relationships.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Word counting is a simple task that doesn't require detailed word analysis.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Alphabetical arrangement is a basic sorting task, not the purpose of word analysis."

        "b": "Correct! Font size is a visual presentation feature, not a linguistic feature of words.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Number (singular/plural) is a fundamental grammatical feature.",

        "a": "They are exactly the same thing",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. While related, root and stem have distinct linguistic definitions.",
        "b": "Correct! The root is the basic form of a word, while the stem is the root plus any derivational affixes.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Length is not a defining characteristic of either root or stem.",

        "d": "It shows the word's origin"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Script is not about font styling but about the writing system.",
        "b": "Correct! Script indicates the writing system used, such as roman for English or devanagari for Hindi.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Pronunciation is handled by phonetics, not script.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Word origin is studied in etymology, not script analysis."
