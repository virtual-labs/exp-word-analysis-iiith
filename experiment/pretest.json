        "b": "bar graph",
        "c": "directed graph",
        "d": "weighted graph"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. An undirected graph is a valid type of graph in computer science where edges have no direction, meaning connections between vertices are bidirectional.",
        "b": "Correct! A bar graph is a type of statistical chart used for data visualization, not a graph data structure in computer science.",
        "c": "Incorrect. A directed graph (digraph) is a fundamental graph type in computer science where edges have direction, indicating one-way relationships between vertices.",
        "d": "Incorrect. A weighted graph is a valid graph type in computer science where edges have numerical values (weights) representing costs, distances, or other metrics."

      "question": "What is vertex coloring of a graph?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A condition where any two vertices having a common edge should not have same color",
        "b": " A condition where any two vertices having a common edge should always have same color",
        "c": "A condition where all vertices should have a different color",
        "d": "A condition where all vertices should have same color"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! Vertex coloring requires that adjacent vertices (those connected by an edge) must have different colors. This ensures no two connected vertices share the same color.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This is the opposite of vertex coloring rules. Connected vertices must have different colors, not the same color.",
        "c": "Incorrect. While vertices connected by edges must have different colors, vertices that aren't connected can share the same color. Not all vertices need different colors.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Having all vertices the same color would violate the basic rule of vertex coloring, as adjacent vertices would have the same color."

    {
      "question": "In a properly vertex-coloured graph, what can you say about the colours of connected vertices (vertices with an edge between them)?",
      "answers": {
        "a": " They must all have the same colour",
        "b": "They must all have different colours",
        "c": "They can have any colour",
        "d": "None of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Connected vertices cannot have the same color in a proper vertex coloring - this would violate the basic rule of graph coloring.",
        "b": "Correct! In a properly vertex-colored graph, any two vertices that share an edge (connected vertices) must have different colors to maintain a valid coloring.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Connected vertices cannot have any arbitrary color - they must have different colors to maintain a proper vertex coloring.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The statement that connected vertices must have different colors is true, making option b the correct answer."

      "question": "A graph G has a chromatic number of 2. What can you conclude about G?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "G is a complete graph.",
        "b": " G is a bipartite graph.",
        "c": "G can only be coloured with exactly 2 colours.",
        "d": "G must have an even number of vertices."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. A complete graph with n vertices requires n colors, so it cannot have a chromatic number of 2 unless it has only 2 vertices.",
        "b": "Correct! A graph with chromatic number 2 is bipartite, meaning its vertices can be divided into two independent sets where no vertices within the same set are connected.",
        "c": "Incorrect. While the graph can be colored with 2 colors, it can also be colored with more colors. The chromatic number represents the minimum number of colors needed.",
        "d": "Incorrect. A bipartite graph (chromatic number 2) can have either an even or odd number of vertices."

    {
      "question": "A friend claims they coloured a graph with 10 vertices and only needed 1 colour.  Is this possible?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "No, this is not possible for any graph with more than 1 vertex",
        "b": "Yes, it's always possible to colour any graph with just 1 colour",
        "c": "It depends on the specific connections in the graph",
        "d": "Maybe, but it's very unlikely."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. A graph with no edges (null graph) can be colored with just one color, regardless of the number of vertices.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Most graphs require multiple colors due to connections between vertices.",
        "c": "Correct! If the graph has no edges (null graph), it can be colored with one color. If it has any edges, it needs at least two colors.",
        "d": "Incorrect. It's not about probability - it depends entirely on whether the graph has any edges."

        "b": "3 colors",
        "c": "4 colors",
        "d": "5 colors"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. A cycle graph with 5 vertices cannot be colored with just 2 colors as it's not bipartite.",
        "b": "Correct! A cycle graph with 5 vertices (C5) requires exactly 3 colors for proper vertex coloring. This is because it forms an odd cycle.",
        "c": "Incorrect. While 4 colors would work, it's not the minimum number needed. C5 can be properly colored with just 3 colors.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Using 5 colors would work but is excessive. The minimum number needed is 3 colors."

        "b": "2",
        "c": "n/2",
        "d": "n"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. A complete graph needs different colors for each vertex as every vertex is connected to every other vertex.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Two colors are only sufficient for a complete graph with 2 vertices (K2).",
        "c": "Incorrect. Half the number of vertices is not sufficient as every vertex in a complete graph is connected to every other vertex.",
        "d": "Correct! In a complete graph, every vertex is connected to every other vertex, so each vertex must have a different color, requiring n colors."

      "question": "In graph coloring, what is Brooks' theorem?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Every graph can be colored with maximum degree + 1 colors",
        "b": "For any connected graph G that is not complete or an odd cycle, χ(G) ≤ Δ(G)",
        "c": "All planar graphs can be colored with 4 colors",
        "d": "The chromatic number is always equal to the maximum degree"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. While this is often true, Brooks' theorem is more specific about when exactly this bound can be improved.",
        "b": "Correct! Brooks' theorem states that for any connected graph G that is neither a complete graph nor an odd cycle, the chromatic number χ(G) is at most equal to the maximum degree Δ(G) of the graph.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This is the Four Color Theorem, not Brooks' theorem.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The chromatic number can be less than the maximum degree in many cases."

        "a": "It creates planar graphs with chromatic number 4",
        "b": "It generates graphs with high chromatic number and low clique number",
        "c": "It proves that all graphs are 3-colorable",
        "d": "It shows that all graphs need at least n colors"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The Mycielski construction is not specifically related to planar graphs or 4-coloring.",
        "b": "Correct! The Mycielski construction is a method for creating graphs with arbitrarily high chromatic numbers while keeping the clique number low, disproving the conjecture that graphs with high chromatic numbers must contain large complete subgraphs.",
        "c": "Incorrect. In fact, it proves the opposite by constructing graphs that need more than 3 colors.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The construction shows that graphs can need many colors even without containing large complete subgraphs."

        "c": "To count the number of words in a text",
        "d": "To arrange words alphabetically"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. While translation is a use case, word analysis focuses on understanding word structure and features.",
        "b": "Correct! Word analysis helps identify grammatical categories, morphological features, and word relationships.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Word counting is a simple task that doesn't require detailed word analysis.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Alphabetical arrangement is a basic sorting task, not the purpose of word analysis."
