### Experiment Objectives

After completing this experiment, students will be able to:

1. **Analyze Word Structure**: Identify and decompose words into their morphological components (root + affixes) with 80% accuracy across different word categories (nouns, verbs, adjectives).

2. **Apply Grammatical Features**: Correctly identify and classify morphological features including gender, number, person, case, and tense for words in both English and Hindi, demonstrating understanding of how these features modify word forms.

3. **Compare Language Morphology**: Analyze and compare the morphological richness and patterns between English and Hindi, understanding how different languages encode grammatical information through word formation.

4. **Practice Morphological Analysis**: Develop hands-on skills in performing systematic morphological analysis using the interactive simulation, applying theoretical knowledge to practical word analysis tasks.

#### Learning Focus
- Decompose words into root and affix components
- Identify grammatical features that modify word forms
- Compare morphological patterns across English and Hindi
- Apply morphological analysis principles to real linguistic data
