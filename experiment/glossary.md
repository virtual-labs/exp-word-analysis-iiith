## Core Morphological Terms

**Morphology**: The study of the internal structure of words and how they are formed from smaller meaningful units called morphemes.

**Morpheme**: The smallest meaningful unit of language that cannot be further divided. For example, in "cats", "cat" and "-s" are morphemes.

**Root**: The core meaning-bearing part of a word that remains after removing all affixes. Example: "play" in "playing", "played", "plays".

**Affix**: A morpheme that is attached to a root to modify its meaning or grammatical function. Includes prefixes, suffixes, and infixes.

**Inflectional Morphology**: Word formation that changes grammatical features (like tense, number, person) without changing the word's core meaning or category.

**Derivational Morphology**: Word formation that creates new words, often changing the grammatical category (e.g., "happy" → "happiness").

## Grammatical Features

**Gender**: A grammatical category that classifies nouns and related words. In this experiment: male, female, or NA (not applicable).

**Number**: Indicates whether a word refers to one (singular) or more than one (plural) entity.

**Person**: Indicates the relationship between the speaker, listener, and the subject of the sentence:
- First person: speaker (I, we)
- Second person: listener (you)
- Third person: others (he, she, they)

**Case**: Indicates the grammatical function of a noun in a sentence. In this experiment, refers to script type (Devanagari, Roman).

**Tense**: Indicates when an action occurs relative to the time of speaking (present, past, future).

**Aspect**: Indicates how an action is viewed in terms of its completion or duration (perfect, continuous, habitual).

## Language-Specific Terms

**Devanagari**: The writing system used for Hindi and several other Indian languages.

**Roman**: The Latin alphabet writing system used for English and many other languages.

**Postposition**: A word that follows a noun to indicate grammatical relationships (similar to prepositions in English). Common in Hindi: का(kaa), की(kii), के(ke), को(ko), में(meM).

**Oblique Case**: A grammatical case used when a postposition follows a noun in Hindi.

**Direct Case**: A grammatical case used when no postposition follows a noun in Hindi.

## Analysis Terms

**Morphological Analysis**: The process of breaking down words into their constituent morphemes and identifying their grammatical features.

**Lexical Category**: The grammatical class of a word (noun, verb, adjective, adverb, pronoun, preposition, conjunction).

**Word Form**: A specific inflectional or derivational variant of a root word.

**Morphological Richness**: The degree to which a language uses inflectional morphology to encode grammatical information.
