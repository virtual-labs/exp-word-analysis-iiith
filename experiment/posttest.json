      "question": "In the word analysis simulation, what is the first step in analyzing a word?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Selecting the word's features",
        "b": "Choosing the language",
        "c": "Identifying the root",
        "d": "Determining the tense"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Feature selection comes after choosing the language and word.",
        "b": "Correct! The simulation requires selecting the language first to determine available words and features.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Root identification is part of feature analysis, which comes later.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Tense is one of the features analyzed after word selection."

    {
      "question": "What happens when you select a language in the simulation?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "All feature options become available immediately",
        "b": "The word selection dropdown becomes enabled",
        "c": "The correct answer is shown",
        "d": "The simulation resets"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Features are only available after selecting a word.",
        "b": "Correct! Language selection enables the word dropdown, allowing you to choose from available words in that language.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The answer is only shown when requested after feature selection.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The simulation maintains its state after language selection."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Gender is a key feature analyzed in the simulation.",
        "b": "Correct! Font style is a presentation feature, not a linguistic feature analyzed in the simulation.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Number (singular/plural) is a fundamental feature in the analysis.",

      "question": "How does the simulation handle feature selection for different word categories?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "All features are always available for every word",
        "b": "Features are dynamically filtered based on the word's category",
        "c": "Only three features can be selected at a time",
        "d": "Features are randomly assigned to words"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Not all features apply to all word categories.",
        "b": "Correct! The simulation shows relevant features based on the word's category (e.g., tense for verbs, gender for nouns).",
        "c": "Incorrect. The number of features depends on the word's category and language.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Features are systematically determined by the word's properties."

      "question": "What is the purpose of the 'Check Answer' button in the simulation?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To show the correct answer immediately",
        "b": "To verify if selected features match the word's actual properties",
        "c": "To reset the simulation",
        "d": "To skip to the next word"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The 'Show Answer' button reveals the correct answer.",
        "b": "Correct! The 'Check Answer' button validates if your selected features match the word's actual grammatical properties.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The button is for validation, not resetting.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The simulation doesn't automatically advance to the next word."

    {
      "question": "How does the simulation handle language-specific features?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "All languages use the same feature set",
        "b": "Features are adapted based on the selected language's grammatical system",
        "c": "Only English features are available",
        "d": "Features are randomly assigned for each language"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Different languages have different grammatical features.",
        "b": "Correct! The simulation adapts available features based on the selected language's grammatical system (e.g., gender in Hindi, case in both languages).",
        "c": "Incorrect. The simulation supports multiple languages with their specific features.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Features are systematically determined by each language's grammar."

      "question": "What is the significance of the 'script' feature in the simulation?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It only affects the visual display of words",
        "b": "It determines the writing system and influences available features",
        "c": "It's only relevant for English words",
        "d": "It's automatically set and cannot be changed"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Script is more than just visual display.",
        "b": "Correct! The script feature (roman/devanagari) determines the writing system and affects which features are available for analysis.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Script is relevant for all supported languages.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Script is determined by the language selection."

    {
      "question": "How does the simulation handle feature dependencies?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "All features are independent of each other",
        "b": "Some features are interdependent (e.g., gender affecting number forms)",
        "c": "Features are always selected in a specific order",
        "d": "Dependencies are randomly generated"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Many features are grammatically interdependent.",
        "b": "Correct! The simulation maintains grammatical dependencies between features (e.g., gender-number agreement, person-tense relationships).",
        "c": "Incorrect. While there's a logical order, it's not strictly enforced.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Dependencies are based on linguistic rules, not randomness."

      "question": "What is the role of the 'Show Answer' button in the learning process?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "It only shows the correct answer without explanation",
        "b": "It provides a complete analysis of the word's features with explanations",
        "c": "It automatically moves to the next word",
        "d": "It resets all selected features"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The button provides detailed feature information.",
