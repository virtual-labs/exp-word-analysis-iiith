      "question": "What is a morpheme in linguistics?",

        "c": "A type of grammar rule",
        "d": "A writing system"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. A sentence is made up of many morphemes.",
        "b": "Correct! A morpheme is the smallest meaningful unit of language that cannot be divided further while retaining meaning.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Grammar rules govern how morphemes combine, but are not morphemes themselves.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Writing systems represent morphemes but are not morphemes themselves."

        "c": "Three",
        "d": "Four"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. 'Cats' contains more than one meaningful unit.",
        "b": "Correct! 'Cats' has two morphemes: 'cat' (the root) and '-s' (the plural marker).",
        "c": "Incorrect. There are only two meaningful units in 'cats'.",

        "c": "-ness",
        "d": "unhappy"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. 'un-' is a prefix, not the root.",
        "b": "Correct! 'Happy' is the root word that carries the core meaning, with 'un-' as prefix and '-ness' as suffix.",
        "c": "Incorrect. '-ness' is a suffix that creates nouns from adjectives.",
        "d": "Incorrect. 'Unhappy' includes the prefix 'un-' and is not the root."

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This is derivational morphology as it changes the word class from adjective to noun.",
        "b": "Correct! Adding '-ed' to 'walk' shows inflectional morphology as it changes the tense without changing the word class.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This is derivational morphology as it creates a new word with a different meaning and class.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This is derivational morphology as it changes the word class from adjective to noun."

        "b": "Correct! 'को' (ko) is used to mark direct objects, goals, or recipients in Hindi sentences.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Possessive relationships are marked by 'का/की/के' (ka/ki/ke).",

        "d": "There is no difference between them"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! Free morphemes can function as independent words (like 'cat'), while bound morphemes must attach to other morphemes (like '-s' in 'cats').",
        "b": "Incorrect. Length is not the distinguishing factor between free and bound morphemes.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Bound morphemes can be prefixes, suffixes, or infixes.",

        "d": "There are no grammatical rules"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Agglutinative languages have complex internal word structure.",
        "b": "Correct! Agglutinative languages allow extensive morpheme chaining, creating words with many grammatical markers that must be analyzed separately.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Agglutinative languages often have polysyllabic words due to morpheme chaining.",

        "d": "When sentences are too long"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! Morphological ambiguity occurs when a word form can be analyzed in multiple ways, requiring context or additional information to determine the correct analysis.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Spelling errors are orthographic issues, not morphological ambiguity.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Script differences are writing system issues, not morphological ambiguity.",

        "a": "Correct! Morphological analysis provides crucial grammatical information (tense, number, gender, case) that helps produce more accurate and grammatically correct translations.",
        "b": "Incorrect. While it may help efficiency, the primary benefit is accuracy, not speed.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Morphological analysis complements rather than replaces dictionary lookup.",
