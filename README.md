## Overview

This Virtual Lab experiment focuses on **Morphological Analysis of Words**, providing an interactive learning experience for understanding how words are structured and how grammatical features are encoded across different languages.

## Experiment Structure

### ðŸ“š Core Learning Materials

1. **[Aim](aim.md)** - Clear learning objectives and focus areas
2. **[Objectives](objective.md)** - Specific, measurable learning goals
3. **[Theory](theory.md)** - Comprehensive background on morphological analysis
4. **[Procedure](procedure.md)** - Step-by-step instructions for the simulation
5. **[Glossary](glossary.md)** - Key terms and definitions for reference

### ðŸŽ¯ Assessment & Practice

- **[Pre-test](pretest.json)** - 9 questions to assess prior knowledge
- **[Post-test](posttest.json)** - 9 questions to measure learning outcomes
- **[Assignment](assignment.md)** - Additional practice exercises

### ðŸš€ Enhanced Learning Experience

- **[Did You Know?](did-you-know.md)** - Fascinating facts and real-world applications
- **[Further Exploration](further-exploration.md)** - Advanced topics and research opportunities
- **[References](references.md)** - Comprehensive resource list for deeper study

### ðŸ’» Interactive Simulation

The experiment includes a fully functional web-based simulation located in the `simulation/` directory that allows students to:

- Select between English and Hindi languages
- Analyze words by identifying their morphological components
- Practice identifying grammatical features (gender, number, person, case, tense)
- Receive immediate feedback on their analysis
- Compare morphological patterns across languages

## Learning Path

### For Beginners
1. Start with the **[Aim](aim.md)** and **[Objectives](objective.md)** to understand what you'll learn
2. Read the **[Theory](theory.md)** for foundational concepts
3. Refer to the **[Glossary](glossary.md)** for unfamiliar terms
4. Follow the **[Procedure](procedure.md)** to use the simulation
5. Take the pre-test and post-test to track your progress

### For Intermediate Learners
1. Complete the core materials above
2. Explore **[Did You Know?](did-you-know.md)** for interesting applications
3. Try the **[Assignment](assignment.md)** exercises
4. Use the **[References](references.md)** to dive deeper into specific topics

### For Advanced Learners
1. Complete all basic materials
2. Explore **[Further Exploration](further-exploration.md)** for research opportunities
3. Consider implementing computational morphology projects
4. Contribute to language documentation or NLP research

## Key Learning Outcomes
